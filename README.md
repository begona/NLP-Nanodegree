# NLP-Nanodegree
Projects developed during the nanodegree specialized in NLP at Udacity.

__HMM tagger:__ I have used the Pomegranate library to build a __hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging__ with a universal tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

__NLP capstone:__ I build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end __machine translation__ pipeline. The completed pipeline accept English text as input and return the French translation.

__VUI speech recognition:__ I build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end __automatic speech recognition (ASR)__ pipeline!

__Sentiment rnn:__ I implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the sequence of words
